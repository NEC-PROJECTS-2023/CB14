### Introduction
Indian Economy is highly dependent on agricultural productivity of the country. Grape is very commercial fruit of India. It can easily be grown in all tropical, sub-tropical and temperate climatic regions. India has got different types of climate and soil in different parts of the country. This makes grapevines a major vegetative propagated crop with high socioeconomic importance. The grape plant will cause poor yield and growth when affected by diseases. The diseases are due to the viral, bacteria and fungi infections which are caused by insects,rust and nematodes etc., These diseases are judged by the farmers through their experience or with the help of experts through naked eye observation which is not accurate and time consuming process. Early detection of disease is then very much needed in the agriculture and horticulture field to increase the yield of the crops. We have proposed a system that can detect and identify diseases in the leaves of the grape plants.
